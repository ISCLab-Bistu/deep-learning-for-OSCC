# Introduction
This repository contains five implementations of one-dimensional classical neural networks for the detection of multiple oral cancer types. The purpose of this study is to test, compare and analyze the performance of existing classical deep neural network models (AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, Transformer) for identifying multiple types of oral cancer tissues. In order to adapt Raman spectroscopy to the application scenario of oral cancer, this study complete model training at the subject level. Based on this, we further develope a prototype intelligent detection system with the above five classical deep neural network models to achieve multiple types of oral cancer tissue detection, which provides an auxiliary diagnostic basis for surgeons to diagnose oral cancer. This work was completed by Intelligent Sensing and Computing Laboratory affiliated to Beijing Information Science and Technology University. It has been submitted to the Journal of "Photodiagnosis and Photodynamic Therapy" published by Elsevier.
